## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select a quiz subject
- Select a single answer from each question from a choice of four
- See an error message when trying to submit an answer without making a selection
- See if they have made a correct or incorrect choice when they submit an answer
- Move on to the next question after seeing the question result
- See a completed state with the score after the final question
- Play again to choose another subject
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the entire app only using their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Change the app's theme between light and dark

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - React library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

####React Router
Implementing React-router allowed me to navigate between different pages without reloading the entire page, making the app feel like a single-page application.
It also allows for dynamic segments which allows URL parameters to be passed to the link.
```js
 #####main.tsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import {
  createBrowserRouter,
  RouterProvider,
} from "react-router-dom";
import LayOut from './routes/LayOut.tsx';
import HomePage from './pages/HomePage.tsx';
import ExercisePage from './pages/ExercisePage.tsx';
import CompletedPage from './pages/CompletedPage.tsx';

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <LayOut children={undefined}/>,
    children:[
      {path:'/',element:<HomePage/>},
      {path:'/:exercise-type',element:<ExercisePage/>},
      {path:'/completed/:exercise-type/:score',element:<CompletedPage/>},
      
    ]
  },
]);


ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router}/>
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources

- [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - I used this for client-side routing. I really love this because it was quick and intuitive to use.
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics) - This is also an amazing react library that allows you to manipulate your CSS with Javascript. It's usage is very intuitive and easy as well. And it made my life a whole lot easier when I was implementing the darkmode feature. I would probably recommend this over frontend libraries like tailwind
